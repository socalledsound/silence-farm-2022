                        Silence farm is, basically, a granular synthesizer, built using the web audio API.

                    <p className="about-text">
                        Via the controls icon at the top, you can control the parameters of individual voices, and also 
                        some parameters of the overall mix.
                    </p>
                    <p className="about-text">
                            The 'mutation' parameter under 'all sounds' controls a random value that loads new sound files into the mix.  
                            Each sound file is a 'voice' that you can toggle on or off.  
                            At somewhat random intervals, each one of these voices generates a new sound grain, a little chunk of the audio file.
                            You can control the fade in, fade out, duration, pitch and volume of these grains, and also the regularity
                            with which a new grain is generated, aka the density. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="about-text">
                        The sound files are a combination of sounds that I had in my library and sounds that people like you have uploaded from around the world.
                        Each one of these sounds is a 'room tone', a recording a of a room in silence.
                        
                    </p>

                    <p className="about-text">
                        If you want to, you can also upload your own ambient environment for inclusion in the mix.  
                        If you're concerned about privacy, there's a little bit about that below.
