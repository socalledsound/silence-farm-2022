                        Silence farm is, basically, a granular synthesizer, built using the web audio API.

                        Via the controls icon at the top, you can control the parameters of individual voices, and also 
                        some parameters of the overall mix.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text">
                            The 'mutation' parameter under 'all sounds' controls a random value that loads new sound files into the mix.  
                            Each sound file is a 'voice' that you can toggle on or off.  
                            At somewhat random intervals, each one of these voices generates a new sound grain, a little chunk of the audio file.
                            You can control the fade in, fade out, duration, pitch and volume of these grains, and also the regularity
                            with which a new grain is generated, aka the density. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="text">
                        The sound files are a combination of sounds that I had in my library and sounds that people like you have uploaded from around the world.
                        Each one of these sounds is a 'room tone', a recording a of a room in silence.
                        
                    </p>

                    <p className="text">
                        If you want to, you can also upload your own ambient environment for inclusion in the mix.  
                        If you're concerned about privacy, there's a little bit about that below.
